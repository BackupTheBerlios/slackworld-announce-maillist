Subject: The Slack World: "A How To on Creating a chroot Environment",
	by Tom Newsom
Message-ID: <20070217225505.082e4f57.slackworld@gmail.com>

"chroot - run command or interactive shell with special root directory"
(man chroot) This doesn't sound very inspiring, does it?  Go read "A How
To on Creating a chroot Environment" by Tom Newsom and you will find
chroot to be one of the most exciting commands in your Linux box:

At least, we hope so :-)

Ladies and gentlemen, folks, and fellow slackers:

In early March, Grant Coady became a happy owner of a brand new 64-bit

Here one can find a brief diary of the first few days of Grant's life in
the slack 64-bit world:

Subject: The Slack World: Using VMware Server, by Grant Coady
Message-ID: <20070602161453.f1e99c6a.e-boogie@yandex.ru>

Dear fellow slackers,

Suppose you need to run both Slackware Linux and another OS on the same
machine.  Dual booting provides a well-established solution. Still, there
is another way to accomplish the task. Namely, to run a virtual machine. 
In his new article, Grant Coady shares his experience of running the
latest VMware Server:
