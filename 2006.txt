Subject: The Slack World: Slack Rock Band in a Few Easy Steps
Message-ID: <20061202100946.12eec929.slackworld@gmail.com>

Dear Slackers:

Some time ago I asked a legendary AOLS regular (and, accidentally,
a musician) Loki Harfarg to tell me about the gear used to record his
latest album "A Dirty Dozen". If you have ever thought about playing in a
rock band or having a rock group of your own or just wondered if there is
anything in common between Music and Linux or just want to have a good
reading, you should definitely check Loki's story. Here it comes:
"Slack Rock Band in a Few Easy Steps":

Enjoy!
