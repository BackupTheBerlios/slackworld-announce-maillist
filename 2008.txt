Dear fellow Slackers,

Are you on old school Amiga user who gave up that most brilliant of
operating systems? Even in case you aren't, we believe you will enjoy
reading "Tux meets Amiga, or Amiga emulation using UAE or E-UAE"
by Tom Newsom.

The article is available here:

Yours,
The Slack World guys

Subject: The Slack World: Tux meets Amiga, part 2: Porting AmiKit to Linux
Message-ID: <20080320114718.5c96d7c0@mojo.having.fun>

Dear fellow Slackers,

We are very glad to present the second article by Tom Newsom on running Amiga 
in Linux. This is not just a review of another Amiga emulator but an emotional
history of the process of creating and debugging a working port of AmiKit to Linux. Yes, it's hard to believe but "Tux meets Amiga," published earlier this
year, caused or at least stimulated the appearance of a great new tool for all
fans of Linux and Amiga.
